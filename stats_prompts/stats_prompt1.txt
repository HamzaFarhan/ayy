- Scores should follow an approximately normal distribution
- Include whole numbers only
- Ask students to:
  1. Calculate central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
  2. Calculate dispersion measures (standard deviation)
  3. Create and interpret a visual representation
  4. Analyze distribution characteristics
- Context should be academic performance, athletic records, or scientific measurements
- Include a plausible real-world scenario
