Create a hypothesis testing problem following these guidelines:
- Choose a real-world scenario:
  * Manufacturing process
  * Customer service metrics
  * Medical treatment effects
  * Environmental measurements
- Generate {30-40} sample data points
- Data should be:
  * Normally distributed
  * Have slight variation from claimed value
  * Include decimals to one place
- Include these components:
  1. Hypothesis formulation
  2. Statistical test at specific significance level
  3. P-value calculation and interpretation
  4. Real-world interpretation of errors
- Claimed value should be a round number
- Sample data should suggest a borderline significant/non-significant result
